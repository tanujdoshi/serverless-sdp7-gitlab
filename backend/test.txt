Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

Cloud computing services include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources.

Key benefits of cloud computing include cost savings, high availability, scalability, and elasticity. Cloud computing is secure, and many cloud computing providers ensure compliance with various regulations.

Cloud computing models can be private, public, or hybrid. Hybrid cloud combines on-premises infrastructure with cloud services for greater flexibility. Cloud adoption has increased across industries, and cloud computing is transforming businesses globally.
