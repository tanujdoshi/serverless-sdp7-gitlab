Word clouds are a powerful way to visualize text data. The size of each word represents its frequency or importance within the dataset. Word clouds are often used for analyzing survey responses, customer feedback, or large text documents.

Visualization tools like word clouds make it easy to identify key themes and patterns in text data. Words like "data," "text," "visualization," and "feedback" may appear larger, indicating their significance.

Use cases for word clouds include analyzing marketing copy, tracking trending topics on social media, or exploring research keywords in academic papers. The simplicity and clarity of word clouds make them popular for presentations and reports.
